Global Cancer Patient Analysis Dashboard (2015–2024)
This Power BI dashboard presents an insightful analysis of global cancer patient data from 2015 to 2024. The visualizations explore demographics, health risk factors, treatment details, and cancer progression stages. The goal is to identify patterns and key health indicators to support healthcare planning and awareness.

🔍 Key KPIs Displayed:
Average Age of Patients: 54.42 years

Average Survival Duration Post Diagnosis: 5.01 years

Average Treatment Cost: $52.47K

Average Alcohol Consumption Score: 5.01%

🌍 Patient Demographics
Patient Count by Country: Balanced distribution across major countries including Australia, UK, USA, India, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Pakistan, China, and Canada, each contributing around ~5,000 cases.

This ensures global representation in the dataset, helping generalize patterns.

🧬 Health Risk Indicators by Gender
This section provides a comparison of severity, genetic risk, and lifestyle impact based on gender:

Target Severity Score

Genetic Risk Score

Observations:

All genders have closely aligned risk levels.

Females show slightly higher severity, while males show marginally lower risk on average.

📆 Time Range Filter
A slicer allows filtering the data between 2015 to 2024, enabling year-wise trend exploration and comparison.

🧪 Cancer Stage Distribution
Displays the distribution of cancer patients across six clinical stages (Stage 0 through Stage IV).

Most stages have a near-equal share (~20% each), indicating consistent diagnosis distribution across severity levels.

🧠 Obesity Level & Average Age by Cancer Type
Compares average age and obesity level of patients across different cancer types like:

Lung, Prostate, Leukemia, Skin, Cervical, Liver, Breast, Colon.

Most cancer types affect patients around age 54–55, with a uniform average obesity level of 5 across all types.
